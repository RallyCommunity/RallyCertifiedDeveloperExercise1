Exercise 1 - Data Stores
=========================

## Overview

1. Create a WSAPI DataStore in your App.  and have that store output "Loaded" to the console.
2. Add a listener using the `.on` function to the store you have created. Have that function call the `fireFromTheStore` function. (bonus fire the function from the scope of the App)
3. Add a filter to your store to return only blocked stories.
